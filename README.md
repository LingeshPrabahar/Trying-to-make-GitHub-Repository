EEE123 – COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FOR ENGINEERS 
Semester I - 2022/2023
Mini Project GROUP 3

 WHAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT?
 • Research work (search for necessary information regarding the project, additional C++ 
commands, functions and code segments not taught by lecturer due to time constraint)
• Program writing (code your solution)
• Typed-Report (with complete coding, and input data attached as appendices)
• Video demonstration – 10 minutes

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
In attempting your project:
1. You must make use of ALL topics learned from the beginning until the end of this course.
Your coding must be modular by implementing at least 10 functions. The main program must 
only involve calls to functions, to show the complete sequence of tasks to be executed.
2. You need to make your own assumptions if necessary to properly bound the Project scope,
particularly if your title is too broad. Write the assumptions as comment in your code as well 
as in the report.
3. Your program must be generic (i.e., can be used with any change in the size of data), producing 
a sustainable system.
4. Your coding must be modular (i.e., use one function for one task solution).
5. Your system must be user-friendly, and produce easy-to understand instructions and output 
display. All user interface is through the terminal/command prompt ONLY (no Window user 
interface with clickable buttons, forms etc. are allowed)
6. Your system must be able to handle errors from user's input.
7. You must create your own data. The data have to be saved in a file and attached as an
appendix in your report. You have to use the data to demonstrate correctness of your code
for verification part of the work.
8. You must test your program using all possible input test data (as explained in 3.), analyse the
result of each test data and discuss why such result is obtained.
9. The top lines of all functions AND main program MUST contain comments stating the
Programmers’ name, and function purpose.
